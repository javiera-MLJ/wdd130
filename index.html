            <p>hello my name is javiera and i am from puerto montt, chile, i am 22 years old and i am a member of the church of jesus christ of the saints of the last days, apart from that i work as an administrative secretary and i keep myself very busy day to day.</p>
            <p>I returned a year ago from my mission in Buenos Aires Argentina and I am very proud to have been able to serve in that place. I was able to help many people understand that the gospel is a path to happiness in their lives and I could see how people decided to convert to make that change and follow Christ.</p>
            <p>I am currently studying programming with the idea of one day being able to program applications focused on medicine.</p>
